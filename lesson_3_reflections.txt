When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository is useful for collaborating with others. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to wait to share changes until your work is ready for others to review.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are GitHub-to-GitHub copies of someone else's repository. Clones are copies of repositories that are local-local,
local-GitHub, or GitHub-local. Branches are separate versions of the same project that are made to work on new
features or versions without disrupting the production version.
