What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This enables you to start tracking changes in Git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to consolidate multiple files that you want to commit at the same time. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Group files in the staging area by logical change and then commit them all at once.
